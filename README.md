The CFO of Rossmann Drug Stores requested a sales predction for each store for the next six weeks in order to define a budget for stores renovation. The current prediction was not satisfactory as there were several inconsistencies. In this context, I developed a machine learning regression model in order to provide more accurately forecast store sales.

The model provides daily predictions that could be accessed in Telegram with an error (MAPE) of 11%.
